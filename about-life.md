# About Life

## Arguing?

No! Unless you want to give knowledge to others for free. If I were you, I won't do it.

## Control your life

If you can't save yourself, nobody can save you.

Because that's your life. If you don't care about yourself, who cares about you?

Control yourself means to control every part of you.

It also means sometimes, you have to do what you dislike to do if it gets benefits in a long term.
